# YAR 
As an avid Black Desert Online player one of my favorite aspects of the game is Yar which my friends and I use to entertain ourselves when we are waiting for different ingame activities.

# Why Yar
My main reason for trying to recreate Yar for myself is to practice programming and to expand my knowledge in the different languages I plan on using for this project.  
The second reason why I have attempted this is because I don't want my win percentage to decrease in game from messing around and trying my luck against npcs.
